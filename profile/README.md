### Hi, I'm [Hyo](https://github.com/hyochan) ðŸ‘‹

Since 2017, Iâ€™ve been working on open-source projects, managing developer communities, and collaborating with startups. During that time, I operated under the alias **dooboolab**, and in 2021, I founded a software agency under that name. However, after facing several challenges, I decided to step away from the company and am now starting a new chapter.

I have a diverse background in software development, including managing teams, running an agency, and maintaining open-source projects. While Iâ€™ll continue to maintain my projects here on GitHub, my current commitments mean I may not be able to give them as much attention as before.

Moving forward, Iâ€™m looking to connect with talented developers worldwide for remote collaboration, with the hope of working together offline as well in the future. Iâ€™m excited to focus more on solving challenging engineering problems and honing my skills.
